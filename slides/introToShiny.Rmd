## What is an Interactive Visualization?

- Graphs with controls that alter the form or underlying data of graph
- Types of Control:
    - Presentation (type of graph, colors, faceting)
    - Underlying Data (filtering based on criteria)

## Decide the purpose & audience of your interactive visualization

- Very Important! 
- Exploration (Exploratory Data Analysis) 
    - Visualize Trends
    - Understand variability in data
- Answering a scientific question (focused visualization)
    - Is transcript abundance correlated with mutational load?
    - Is alcohol preference associated with behavioral covariates?

## Tips for building interactive visualizations

- Don't show all the data! 
    - Usually, a subset of your data can answer your question
    - filter your dataset beforehand
- Think carefully about the interactive element
    - Each slider and input box should have a purpose!
- Have someone external test your visualization
    - Is it confusing? Do you need to add help?
    - Do the controls make sense?

##What is Shiny?

Shiny is a web presentation framework that allows you to take R code and make it into an interactive visualization. 

Basically, it lets you build interactive websites with User Interface Controls and graphs by using a few lines of R. 

Underneath, Shiny uses JavaScript Libraries (D3 and Bootstrap) to do the real presentation work.

##Running a Shiny App

You can use `runApp()` if your working directory is the same as the app, but I usually just use the `runApp` button in the corner of the Rstudio window when I am editing `global.R`, `ui.R`, or `server.R`.

##Shiny App Architecture

For the workshop, you'll use the Shiny App to do some EDA. You will need to be familiar with the basic architecture of the app, which usually consists of 3 files.

- `ui.R` - This is where the user interface and display elements are. 
    - Communicates with `server.R` with `input` object (values from UI Elements such as `selectInput`).     - Gets output elements for display (such as plots) from the `output` object provided by `server.R`.
- `server.R` - All of the actual processing and plotting goes here. 
    - Gets UI values from `input` object (character, numeric, or boolean)
    - Modifies plot or data if necessary
    - Places the resulting plot output in the `output` object so `ui.R` can access it.
- `global.R` - Optional.
    - Any objects loaded here can be seen by both `ui.R` and `server.R`. 
    - Handy for building interactive UI elements
    - I usually place filtering and preprocessing steps here
        - Renaming columns, changing column datatype, etc

## Other things to remember

The Shiny R session is distinct from anything you do in the console. 

This means that anything you do in console (data loading, data manipulation) is not part of the Shiny App.

## Beyond `data.frames`

The `data.table` package is very fast, and is an alternative to data.table.

For an example of using `data.table`, look at this app: https://github.com/laderast/DreamEDAShiny

## What you'll do today

We'll start with a really simple visualization in `ggplot2` and learn how to modify it in real time with Shiny UI elements. This is enough to get you started.

- Start with a simple visualization (boxplot) with `ggplot2`
- Change the x-axis with a `selectInput()` control
- Filter the data with `dplyr()`
- More, if you have time
